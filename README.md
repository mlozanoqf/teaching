**task** folder: Try to solve these tasks. The purpose is to practice and develop your R coding skills. If you are my student, give it a try. The first task is in png_size.rmd and it is about re-sizing a png picture by using code or additional instructions. The second is a math problem.

**assignment_template** folder: Use it as an rmd template for assignment submission reports in R. 

Regards.
